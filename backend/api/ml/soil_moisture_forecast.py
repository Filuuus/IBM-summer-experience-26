"""
soil_moisture_forecast.py — Temporal baseline projection for Sentineli
======================================================================

Current scope
-------------
We have real SMAP + Daymet data for 2024 only.
For all other years (historical and future) we project the 2024 seasonal
pattern as a static baseline, clearly labeled so the frontend can display
the appropriate caveat.

Future upgrade path
-------------------
A proper multi-year forecast would require either:
  (a) Extended SMAP/Daymet pulls from NASA AppEEARS for each year, or
  (b) A sequence-to-sequence LSTM trained on multi-year TxSON data to
      generate N-step-ahead forecasts.
This module is designed so that (b) can be dropped in by replacing
`project_year()` with a real forecast call without changing any callers.
